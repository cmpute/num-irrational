# num-irrational

This crate provides representations of irrational numbers within following categories:
- Math constants (`pi`, `e`, etc.)
- [Quadratic Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number#Examples)
    - Quadratic irrational aka. Quadratic surd
- [Continued Fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction)
    - Simple continued fraction
    - General continued fraction

It's based on the `num` creates.

# Roadmap
- v0.1: documentation (docstring, examples and readme)
- v0.1: add tests for QuadSurd
- v0.1: full support of complex number for QuadSurd
